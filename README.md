# Echo

## Inspiration
I was inspired by nature in my garden, flowers where everywhere even in the darkest corners, and saw news related to people cutting healthy trees for products

## What it does
It is a website called ECHO, it echoes nature and does all it can to help nature and to make us want to as well.

## How I built it
I built it with HTML, CSS and Javascript

## Challenges I ran into
There were so many challenges ... For example, it was confusing to make the loading screen but I overcame all of the challenges eventually.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of
I am extremly proud of this website and that I was able to build it and contribute to helping nature recover from all the damage humans have done to it.

## What we learned
I learned a lot about HTML, CSS and Javascript, and I am glad to have that knowledge and improve my future projects
